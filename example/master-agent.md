Puppet master-agent setup
=========================

In the master-agent setup, all configuration and data is placed on the master Puppet server. All client nodes
have a Puppet agent that pull a manifest from the master and install the node in the desired state.

I like to spent some time on this, because it is quite interesting. You can [track issue 4](https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-puppet/issues/4) to see when it is out.
